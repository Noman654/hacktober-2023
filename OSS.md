## Spring 2: Licencing

In short, licensing is the legal framework that defines how others can use, modify, and distribute software, content, or creative works. It outlines the permissions and restrictions imposed by the original creator or copyright holder. Open-source licenses, like the MIT License or GNU General Public License (GPL), specify the terms under which software can be freely shared, modified, and distributed by the community.

1. **MIT License:**
   - Permissive and simple license.
   - Allows for almost unrestricted use, modification, and distribution of the code.
   - Requires the inclusion of the original license and copyright notice in derivative works.

2. **GNU General Public License (GPL):**
   - Emphasizes freedom and copyleft.
   - Requires derivative works to be released under the same GPL license.
   - Designed to ensure that software remains open source.

3. **Apache License:**
   - Permissive license with some restrictions on the use of trademarks.
   - Allows for use, modification, and distribution, but contributors grant a patent license to users.

4. **BSD Licenses (2-Clause and 3-Clause):**
   - Permissive licenses similar to the MIT License.
   - Allow for use, modification, and distribution with minimal restrictions.
   - Include clauses addressing the use of the name or endorsement of the project.

5. **Creative Commons Licenses:**
   - Designed for various creative works, including documentation and media.
   - Allows creators to define the permissions and restrictions on their work.

6. **Mozilla Public License (MPL):**
   - Hybrid license combining features of permissive and copyleft licenses.
   - Requires changes to MPL-licensed code to be made available under the MPL.

7. **Eclipse Public License (EPL):**
   - Designed for the Eclipse IDE and related projects.
   - Allows for modification and distribution with certain limitations.

8. **AGPL (Affero General Public License):**
   - Derived from the GPL but focuses on network interaction.
   - Requires modified versions of the code to be distributed when used in a network service.

9. **Unlicense:**
   - Provides a public domain dedication.
   - Allows developers to waive all their copyright and related rights to a piece of code.

10. **Beerware License:**
    - An informal and humorous license.
    - Allows users to do anything they want with the code, as long as they buy the developer a beer if they meet.

When choosing a license, it's crucial to understand the implications and obligations it imposes on users and contributors. Each license serves different purposes, and the choice depends on the goals and values of the project and its community.
