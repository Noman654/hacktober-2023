## Requirements:

- Node.js (>=16.0)

- git

## How to contribute?

- Create a fork of the Repository and clone that repo from the URL assigned to the project in your account.

- Clone the Repository you've made into your system and run:

```
npm install
```

to install all the dependencies.

- To start the project, run:

```
npm run dev
```

- Make your desired changes and push to the origin.

- If you just want to list your name to the list, just do your changes in `./src/config/data.json` by following the schema provided in `./src/config/template.json`. (do not forget to validate the JSON after doing the desired updates. Adding an extra `,` to the file may cause errors).
